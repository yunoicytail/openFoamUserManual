### 10. Files and directories
OpenFOAM saves its data not in a single file, like Fluent does, it uses several different files. Depending on its purpose a specific file is located in one of several folders. 
#### 10.1 Required directories
An OpenFOAM case has a minimal set of files and directories. The directory that contains those folders is called the root directory of the case or case directory. Listing 36 shows the output of the commands pwd and ls when they are invoked from a case directory. The first command returns the absolute path of the current working directory. The second command prints the contents of the current folder. When ls is invoked without any options it returns the names of all non-hidden files and folders. In this case there are three subdirectories (0, constant and system). The fact that these three items are directories and not files is indicated by a different color. If ls is called with the option -l are more detailed list is printed. This detailed list indicates if an entry is a file or a directory. 
```
user@host :∼/ OpenFOAM / user -2.1. x/ run / icoFoam / cavity$ pwd
/ home / user / OpenFOAM / user -2.1. x/ run / icoFoam / cavity
user@host :∼/ OpenFOAM / user -2.1. x/ run / icoFoam / cavity$ ls
0 constant system
user@host :∼/ OpenFOAM / user -2.1. x/ run / icoFoam / cavity$ ls -l
insgesamt 12
drwxrwxr -x 2 user group 4096 Okt 2 14:53 0
drwxrwxr -x 3 user group 4096 Okt 2 14:53 constant
drwxrwxr -x 2 user group 4096 Okt 2 14:53 system
```
Listing 36: Case directory

**0** This is the first of the time-directories. It contains the initial and boundary conditions of all variable quantities. A case does not have to start at time t = 0. However, if there is no specific reason for a case tostart at another time that t = 0, a case will always begin at time t = 0. The name of a time-directory is simply the number of elapsed seconds.  
**constant** This folder contains all files dealing with constant quantities as well as the mesh.  
**polymesh** This is a subdirectory of constant. In this folder all files defining the mesh reside.  
**system** In this folder all files that control the solver or other tools are located.  
In the course of computing the case two kinds of folders are created. First of all, at defined times all information is written two the harddisk. A new time-directory is created with the number of elapsed seconds in its name. In this folder all kinds of files are saved. The number of files is equal or larger than in the 0 -directory containing the initial conditions.  
The second category of directory subsumes all kinds of folders created for all kind of reasons or by all kind of tools, see Section 10.2 for a brief introduction to some of the more common of them.
#### 10.2 Supplemental directories
Directories described in this Section may be created in the course of a computation.  
##### 10.2.1 processor*
If a case is solved in parallel, i.e. the case is computed using more than one processor at the time. In this case the computational domain has to be decomposed into several parts, to divide the problem between the involved parallel processes. The tool that is used to decompose the case created the processor*-directories. The * stands for a consecutive number starting with 0. So, if a case is to be solved using 4 parallel processes, then the domain has to be split into 4 parts. Therefore, the folders processor0 to processor3 are created.  
Every one of the parallel*-directories contains a 0 - and also a constant-directory containing only the mesh. The system-directory remains in the case folder. See Section 12.5 for more information about conducting parallel calculations.  
##### 10.2.2 functions
functions or functionObjects perform all kind of operations during the computation. Each function creates a folder of the same name to save its data in. See Section 49 for more information about functions.
##### 10.2.3 sets
If the tool sample has been used, then all data generated by sample is stored in a folder named sets. See Section 50 for more information about sample.
#### 10.3 Files in system
In the directory named system there are three files for controlling the solver. This files are necessary to run a simulation. Besides them there may also be additional files controlling other tools.
##### 10.3.1 The main files
This files have to be present in the system folder to be able to run a calculation.  
**controlDict** This file contains the controls related to time steps, output interval, etc.  
**fvSchemes** In this file the finite volume discretisation schemes are defined.  
**fvSolution** This files contains controls related to the mathematical solver, solver algorithms and tolerances.  

##### 10.3.2 Additional files
This list contains a selection of the most common files to be found in the system-directory.   
**probesDict** Alternative to the use of the file probesDict, probes can also be defined in the file controlDict.  
**decomposeParDict** Used by decomposePar. In this file the number of subdomains and the method of decomposition are defined.  
**setFieldsDict** Necessary for the tool setFields to initialise field quantities.  
**sampleDict** Definitions for the post-processing tool sample.
