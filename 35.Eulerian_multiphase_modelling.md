35 Eulerian multiphase modelling
In Eulerian two-phase modelling both phases are considered continua even though one phase might consist of
dispersed phase elements (DPEs) such as bubbles, drops or particles. In these simulations the two phases can
be distinguished into a continuous phase and a dispersed phase. This naming scheme refers to the physical
situation. Within the (Eulerian) mathematical description, however, both phases are continua.
As two momentum equations are solved (one per phase), each phase has its own velocity field. However,
there is only one pressure field. Thus, the pressure is the same for both phases; this also applies to the VOF
method. Due to the fact that two continuity99 and two momentum equations are solved, this approach is often
referred to as two fluid model.
The Eulerian description of multi-phase flow is not limited to two phases, however, for reasons of simplicity,
we limit ourselves to the case of two phases.

Figure 89: Modelling approach on the example of a gas-liquid two-phase system.
As the DPEs are considered to be a continuous phase, their properties are averaged over each cell of the
computational domain. Thus, the properties of the dispersed phase are the mean properties of the dispersed
matter. If all DPEs have equal properties (e.g. diameter, density, etc.), then the dispersed phase is referred to as
being mono-disperse. Only in the case of mono-dispersity, the averaging over the cells introduces no additional
errors. If the DPEs have variable properties (e.g. a diameter range), then the dispersed phase is referred to as
being poly-disperse. The correct handling of poly-dispersity requires additional considerations on the models.
35.1 Phase model class
One of the strenghts of object oriented programming is that the class structure in the source code can reflect
the properties and relations of real-world things.
The phase model class in the various two- and multi-phase solvers of OpenFOAM is one example of how
techniques of object oriented programming can be applied. In terms of a multi-phase problem in fluid dynamics
we distinguish different phases.
We now violate the unwritten law of to not cite Wikipedia[Citation needed].
Phase (matter), a physically distinctive form of a substance, such as the solid, liquid, and gaseous
states of ordinary matter—also referred to as a "macroscopic state"
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase
In fluid dynamics phase is a commonly used term. When we intend our code to represent the reality we want
to describe as closely as possible we need to introduce the concept of the phase into our source code. From a
programming point of view properties of a phase – such as viscosity, velocity, etc. – are easy to implement. The
viscosity of a phase is simply a field of values, velocity is another field of values.
Object orientation allows us to translate the idea of the phase into programming language. The basic idea
is that a phase has a viscosity, it also has a velocity. We now create a class named phaseModel and this class
needs to have a viscosity, a velocity and everthing else a phase needs to fit our needs.
The phase model classes follow the code of best practice in object oriented programming to hide internal
data from the outer world and to provide access via the classes methods (data encapsulation, see http://www.
tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_data_encapsulation.htm).
No phases, please
In the single-phase solvers of OpenFOAM – such as simpleFoam – the concept of a phase is not used. As there
is only one temperature and velocity to deal with, the concept of phases is not needed. In the single-phase
solvers the phase-properties (viscosity, velocity, density, etc.) are linked according to the physical relations that
are taken into account, but the concept of a phase is missing.
35.1.1 A comparison of the phase models in OpenFOAM-2.2
In this section we want to compare the implementation of the phase model class of the two solvers twoPhaseEuler-
Foam and multiphaseEulerFoam.

twoPhaseEulerFoam
The phase model class in twoPhaseEulerFoam-2.2.x collects the properties of a phase and offers an interface
for accessing these properties. Listing 225 shows the essence of the header file of the phase model class. The
listing is syntactically correct, however all pre-processor instruction (e.g. the #include statements) have been
removed. Furthermore, most of the comments have been removed and the formatting has been adapted to
reduce the line number. The purpose of Listing 225 is to present the data members and methods of the class
by actual source code.

Listing 225: A boiled-down version of the file phaseModel.H
The phase model class of twoPhaseEulerFoam-2.2.x contains all phase properties needed for an incompressible
two-phase solver that makes use of an important consequence of being limited to two phase problems. By
taking a look on the members of the class we see that there is no volume fraction field. In two phase problems
one volume fraction field (alpha1) suffices as the volume fraction field of the other phase is instantly known
(alpha2 = 1 - alpha1). Thus, the volume fraction can be treated seperately from other phase information.
Another missing item is the pressure. Most two- or multi-phase Eulerian solvers assume/use a common
pressure for all phases. Thus, the pressure is independent of the phases and can be treated seperately.
multiphaseEulerFoam
One difference between the phase model class used in twoPhaseEulerFoam and the one used in multiphaseEuler-
Foam follows directly from the simplification made in the two-phase case. When dealing with an arbitrary
number of phases, each phase must keep track of its own volume fraction. Thus, the volume fraction must be
included into the phase model.
The straight-forward way would be to add another reference to the data members. As the volume fraction
field is a scalar field, this reference would be a reference to a volScalarField. In multiphaseEulerFoam a
more subtle approach was chosen. This also presents the application of another object-oriented programming
technique.
The phase model class of multiphaseEulerFoam is derived from the class volScalarField. Thus, the phase
model class is among other things its own the volume fraction field.

Listing 226 shows a stripped version of the header file of multiphaseEulerFoam’s phase model class. Again,
large parts of the file have been removed leaving only the data members and the methods of the class.

Listing 226: A boiled-down version of the file phaseModel.H
The statements following the class keyword and the class name indicates the derivation of a class. The class
name (phaseModel) and the name of the class we are deriving from (volScalarField) are separated by a colon
(:). The name of the base class (volScalarField) is preceded by a visibility specifier (public). Here, we see a
prototype of a class definition. The class we define (phaseModel) is derived from a base class (volScalarField).

class phaseModel : public volScalarField
{
/* some c++ code */
}
This example highlights, that the class phaseModel is derived from the class volScalarField. This information
alone does no proof that the phase model is its own volume fraction field. However, a glance on the
constructor in the implementation file brings clarity.
In Listing 227 we see, that the first instruction in the initialisation list of the constructor reads the volume
fraction field of the respective phase. This proofes that the phase model is in fact its own volume
fraction field. For an explanation why we come to this conclusion we refer to any C++ textbook or online
resource that covers the concept of inheritance, see e.g. http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/

Listing 227: The first few lines of the constructor of the phase model.
Besides being its own volume fraction field the phase model class of multiphaseEulerFoam was extended by
several fields bearing information for the simulation of thermodynamics.
We can also observe the rudiment of giving the phase model a more active role. The phase model class
of twoPhaseEulerFoam is simply an information carrier. The phase model of multiphaseEulerFoam features a
method named correct(). The correct() method is used in many models for actions performed at every time
step. However, in multiphaseEulerFoam-2.2.x this method is empty.
With OpenFOAM-2.1.0 the class diameterModel was introduced into multiphaseEulerFoam and compressibleTwoPhaseEulerFoam.
The phase model class of multiphaseEulerFoam uses a diameter model class for keeping
track of the dispersed phase’s diameter. The diameter model offers the choice of computing the diameter of
the dispersed phase elements from thermodynamic quantities besides using a constant diameter. Thus, the data
member dimensionedScalar d_ is replaced by a reference to a diameter model (autoPtr<diameterModel> dPtr_).
35.1.2 A comparison of the phase models in OpenFOAM-2.3
In this section we want to compare the implementation of the phase model class of the two solvers twoPhaseEuler-
Foam and multiphaseEulerFoam.
A comment on multiphaseEulerFoam
The phase model class used for multiphaseEulerFoam in OpenFOAM-2.2.x and OpenFOAM-2.3.x differs very
little with respect to the class’s methods and members. Listing 228 shows that the header files of the phaseModel
class of multiphaseEulerFoam differs only in the copyright notice. The implementation file shows slightly greater

differences100. However, the behaviour of this class can be considered nearly identical in OpenFOAM-2.2.x and
OpenFOAM-2.3.x.

Listing 229: A boiled-down version of the file phaseModel.H
The data members of the phase model class in twoPhaseEulerFoam-2.3.x contain a reference to the two-phase
model class. This makes the phase model class aware of the other phase. The data members also contain a
reference to a turbulence model and a thermophysical model. This is up to now the greatest generalisation we
could observe in the multi-phase solvers of OpenFOAM.
35.2 Phase system classes
In a multiphase solver we can not only create an abstraction for the physical phase, e.g. water. We can
also create an abstraction for the multi-phase system, i.e. the entirety of the involved phases. Again, multiphaseEulerFoam
was the forerunner for this idea. Since the introduction of multiphaseEulerFoam there is a
class named multiphaseSystem. In twoPhaseEulerFoam-2.3 the class twoPhaseSystem was introduced. The
most obvious purpose of this class is the implementation of the phase continuity equation. In both solvers the
solution of the continuity equation(s) hides behind the function call fluid.solve().
35.2.1 The class twoPhaseSystem
We now take a detailled look on the class twoPhaseSystem. This class was introduced with twoPhaseEulerFoam-
2.3 and this class seems to be a consequent continuation of ideas introduced in the class multiphaseSystem. We
focus on the class twoPhaseSystem, since the class multiphaseSystem has not really evolved from the release of
OpenFOAM-2.1 til the release of OpenFOAM-2.3. The header and the implementation file are largely identical.
Phase models
Two data members of the class are the two involved phase models phase1_ and phase2_. The class provides
methods to access this phase models. There is also a method to access the other phase. As there are only two

phases involved, this operation is possible.
Phase pair models
In order to cover all possible flow situations the momentum exchange models are defined in the case pair-wise
in a separated fashion, i.e. drag for air dispersed in water (bubbly flow) and drag for water dispersed in air
(droplet flow).
The classes phasePair and orderedPhasePair provide an elegant way to deal with this situation. The
phase pair models are used for blending the interfacial momentum exchange models.
Momentum exchange models
The class has member variables for the interfacial momentum exchange models. Listing 230 shows the members
of the class related to momentum exchange models. The templated class BlendedInterfacialModel<> provides
functionality that is needed for all momentum exchange models. As the class name suggests, the blending is
covered by this class. The template parameter of this class stands for any one of the interfacial momentum
exchange models.
1 // - Drag model
2 autoPtr < BlendedInterfacialModel < dragModel > > drag_ ;
3 // - Virtual mass model
4 autoPtr < BlendedInterfacialModel < virtualMassModel > > virtualMass_ ;
5 // - Heat transfer model
6 autoPtr < BlendedInterfacialModel < heatTransferModel > > heatTransfer_ ;
7 // - Lift model
8 autoPtr < BlendedInterfacialModel < liftModel > > lift_ ;
9 // - Wall lubrication model
10 autoPtr < BlendedInterfacialModel < wallLubricationModel > > wallLubrication_ ;
11 // - Wall lubrication model
12 autoPtr < BlendedInterfacialModel < turbulentDispersionModel > > turbulentDispersion_ ;
Listing 230: The declaration of the momentum exchange members of the class twoPhaseSystem in
twoPhaseSystem.H
A momentum exchange model alone is nice, but what we really need are the contribution to the momentum
equation. Thus, the class twoPhaseSystem provides methods to access the respective force terms or the respective
coefficients. We have seen this force terms and coefficients in action in Section 45.6.
1 // - Return the drag coefficient
2 tmp < volScalarField > dragCoeff () const ;
3 // - Return the virtual mass coefficient
4 tmp < volScalarField > virtualMassCoeff () const ;
5 // - Return the heat transfer coefficient
6 tmp < volScalarField > heatTransferCoeff () const ;
7 // - Return the lift force
8 tmp < volVectorField > liftForce () const ;
9 // - Return the wall lubrication force
10 tmp < volVectorField > wallLubricationForce () const ;
11 // - Return the wall lubrication force
12 tmp < volVectorField > turbulentDispersionForce () const ;
Listing 231: The declaration of the accessing methods for the momentum exchange coefficients of the class
twoPhaseSystem in twoPhaseSystem.H
35.2.2 The class multiphaseSystem
The solver multiphaseEulerFoam uses the class multiphaseSystem. This class seems to be the ancestor of the
class twoPhaseSystem.

Phase pair
The class multiphaseSystem declares a nested class interfacePair. A nested class is a class definition within
another class. Thus, the nested class is hidden from the outside world102.
The phase pair class is used to deal with surface tension, which by definition is a property of a pair of phases,
and drag.
35.3 Turbulence modelling
35.3.1 Modelling strategies
The problem of turbulence modelling in multi-phase problems can be tackled in one of the following fashions. The
methods are sorted by their perceived computational cost. Whereas the first two methods may be equivalent,
the last is definitely more expensive in terms of memory and computational time. However, each of these
methods has its strengths and weaknesses, and its use cases.
Continuous phase only This model solves computes the turbulent properties of the continuous phase and
assumes an algebraic relationship between the turbulent properties of the continuous and the dispersed
phase. The influence of turbulence on the dispersed phase can also be neglected alltogether. In the Fluent
Theory Guide [7] it is noted: [...] is the appropriate model when the concentrations of the secondary
phases are dilute. In this case, interparticle collisions are negligible and the dominant process in the
random motion of the secondary phases is the influence of the primary-phase turbulence. In Fluent this
approach is referred to as dispersed turbulence model.
Mixture In this approach the turbulence model is evaluated for the mixture of all phases, i.e. the mixture
velocity and mixture density are inserted into the turbulence model. The turbulent quantities of each
individual phase are computed with the density ratio between the mixture and the corresponding phase.
The applicability of this model is described in the Fluent Theory Guide [7] as follows: [...] is applicable
when phases separate, for stratified (or nearly stratified) multiphase flows, and when the density ratio
between phases is close to 1.
Per-phase In this case each phase has its own turbulent properties. Because there are additional transport
equations to be solved per phase, this model is the most computational intensive. The Fluent Theory
Guide [7] states: [...] is the appropriate choice when the turbulence transfer among the phases plays a
dominant role.
35.3.2 Implementation in OpenFOAM
In Section 32.1 the frameworks for implementing turbulence modelling within OpenFOAM are discussed. Now
we take a look on multi-phase turbulence and OpenFOAM’s frameworks for modelling turbulence.
The old framework, see Section 32.1.1, allow only for the first two of the described strategies, since only
one turbulence model is employed by the multiphase solvers. The turbulence model is generally a global object
within the solver, as is also the mesh or the run-time object.
The new framework allows for greater flexibility. In the Eulerian multiphase solvers, the turbulence model
has been moved to the phase model. Thus, each phase has its own turbulence model. This allows for all three
modelling strategies discussed in Section 35.3.1. The turbulence modelling employed by twoPhaseEulerFoam
within the new framework is discussed in Section 45.4.
35.4 Interfacial momentum exchange
On the RHS of the momentum equation there are two types of source terms. The first term Fq,i is a force
density acting on the phase q. The second term is a force (density) coefficient Kqp,i which is multiplied by the
relative velocity uR = up − uq between the phases q and p.
The models for interfacial momentum transfer in OpenFOAM are implemented in a way, such that these
models return either a force or a force coefficient103. The distinction between forces and force coefficents is a

matter of convenience. Contributions directly proportional to the velocity, e.g. drag, can be treated differently
than contributions indirectly proportional to the velocity, e.g. the virtual mass force which is proportional to
the time derivative of the relative velocity. Terms directly proportional to the velocity are numerically treated
differently than other terms.
The interfacial momentum transfer due to drag, lift and virtual mass are based on the force acting on
a single bubble. The turbulent dispersion force is observed when the turbulent eddies of the liquid phase
interact with a swarm of bubbles. This interaction tends to disperse bubble swarms [44]. Figure 90 gives a
schematic representation of the different momentum exchange mechanisms between the liquid and the gas phase.

35.5 Diameter models
As mentioned in the previous Section, diameter models were introduced at some point in the multiphase models.
The multiphaseEulerFoam offered since its introduction in version 2.1.0 two diameter models (constant and
isothermal). With twoPhaseEulerFoam-2.3 a further diameter model was introduced, which is available only in
twoPhaseEulerFoam.

35.5.1 No model
The older versions of twoPhaseEulerFoam ( 2.2.x) use no model for the diameter of the dispersed phase
elements (DPE). In all of these versions the phase diameter is a scalar of type dimensionedScalar that is read

from the transportProperties dictionary.
35.5.2 Constant
The constantDiameter diameter model is the implementation of a constant diameter in a framework that
allows for a variable diameter.
Internally, the diameter is still a scalar which is read from transportProperties respectively from phaseProperties.
However, the phase model returns the diameter as a field quantity. Listing 232 shows how a volScalarField
is returned. The private variable d_ is of the type dimensionedScalar.

35.5.3 Isothermal
Gas bubbles change their diameter as the ambient pressure changes. The isothermalDiameter model implements
this behaviour by assuming the change of state to be isothermal.
Generally, the ideal gas law (52) governs the state of a gas.
pV = nRT (52)
under the assumption of an isothermal state
pV = const (53)
Next we introduce the bubble volume
V = d3

For the isothermalDiameter model the user needs to specify a reference pressure and diameter. Listing
233 shows the d() method of the class isothermalDiameter. The reference pressure p0_ and diameter d0_ are
private data members of the class104. With Eqn. (56) the local diameter is computed (Line 10).

35.5.4 IATE
IATE stands for interfacial area transport equation. This model is based on [33]. The IATE diameter model
solves a transport equation for the interfacial curvature kappai_.
Solves for the interfacial curvature per unit volume of the phase rather than interfacial area per
unit volume to avoid stability issues relating to the consistency requirements between the phase
fraction and interfacial area per unit volume.
Class description in IATE.H
In Section 64 we cover the derviation of the governing equations implemented in OpenFOAM from the equations
in [33].
35.6 Thermophysical models
Each phase in a multi-phase simulation is assigned its own set of models with regards to thermo-physical
properties, such as density, dynamic viscosity and specific heat capacity. The set of available models is discussed
in Section 33. In this section, we focus on the use of thermophysical modelling with respect to multiphase
simulations.
35.6.1 A note on using thermophysical properties in BCs
If we want to specify a massflow boundary condition in a multiphase simulation, we need to specify which
density is to be used for computing the velocity BC from the mass flow. Listing 234 shows an example, of how
we can specify massflow BCs. Note, the entry rho, which tells OpenFOAM which density to used to compute
the actual velocity BC.
boundaryField
{
inlet
{
type flowRateInletVelocity ;
massFlowRate 0.2;
rho thermo : rho . air ;
extrapolateProfile no;
value uniform (0 0 0);
}
// ...
}
Listing 234: Specifying a massflow BC in an U.air file, here we need to specify the phase-density.
In multiphase solvers, access to the density field is generally handled by the phase-model class. Thus, the
multiphase solvers do not create registered density fields, in contrast to compressible single-phase solvers, such
as rhoPimpleFoam. As access to the density is handled via the phase model’s thermophysical model, this reflects
in the way we refer to the phase’s density when we e.g. specify a massflow BC.
Note, that in Line 7 of Listing 234 a single colon (:) is used as a separator. This can potentially be confused
with the double colons (::), which are used in C++ to separate namespace qualifiers. However, in a certain way,
we find that this is also a sort of namespace, since the thermo prefix indicates that this field is a field which is
provided by the thermophysical model, as opposed to solver-managed fields, such as p or U.

35.6.2 A note on post-processing thermophysical quantities
Section 35.6.1 also applies, when we want to do some post-processing on thermophysical quantities, e.g. write
out the gas-density field as shown in Listing 235. Here, we also use a single colon (:) to separate the thermo
qualifier from the name of the field, i.e. rho.air. Using a double colon, or just the field’s name alone would
result in an error.
