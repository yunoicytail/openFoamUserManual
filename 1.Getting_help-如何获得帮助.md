# 如何获得帮助

Apart from this manual, there are lots of resources on the internet to find help on OpenFOAM.
• The OpenFOAM User Guide
http://www.openfoam.org/docs/user/
• The CFD Online Forum
http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam/
• The OpenFOAM Wiki
http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Main_Page
The OpenFOAM Wiki is maintained by a community of developers behind the OpenFOAM-extend project.
This wiki covers not only the OpenFOAM but also tools that developed for OpenFOAM, e.g. pyFoam or
swak4foam.
• The OpenFOAM tutorial collection
https://wiki.openfoam.com
This is a community driven effort to collect all the various sources of information, which are all over the
internets. This tutorial collection is more of a register of tutorials from various sources. There are two
curated lists of tutorials, the first glimpse series and the more in-depth three-weeks series which span a
range of topics from the general introduction to quite specific topics. Furthermore, there are also lists of
tutorials sorted by topic or by contributor.
• The CoCoons Project
http://www.cocoons-project.org/
This is a community driven effort to create a documentation on solvers, utilities and modelling.
• The materials of the course CFD with open source software of Chalmers University
http://www.tfd.chalmers.se/~hani/kurser/OS_CFD/
• The CAELinux Wiki
http://caelinux.org/wiki/index.php/Doc:OpenFOAM
CAELinux is a collection of open source CAE software including several CFD codes (OpenFOAM,
Code_Saturne, Gerris, Elmer).
• Q&A on the internets
You can find questions – and hopefully answers – on the various Q&A sites on the internets, such as
StackExchange (http://stackexchange.com/), which is a collection of Q&A site specific to a topic or
region of interest.
Currently, OpenFOAM questions tend to get posted on the Computational Science Q&A site.

• Word of mouth
