5 Updating OpenFOAM-6 source installation
5.1 Motivation
OpenFOAM-6 is kind-of rolling point-release, i.e. the version number remains unchanged, yet there are occasional patch-releases. According to the OpenFOAM Foundation11:
Version 6 is a snapshot of the OpenFOAM development version which, through sustainable
development, is always-releasable. It provides new functionality and major improvements to existing
code, with strict demands on usability, robustness and extensibility.
The initial installation of OpenFOAM-6 follows the steps of any other installation from-source. However,
when a subsequent patch-release is released, we’re left with an OpenFOAM-6 installation that is not equal in
capabilities, features and bugs, than the current OpenFOAM-6 sources.
In ye olden days, we would have been gifted with an OpenFOAM-X.Y++. However, as OpenFOAM-
6 is OpenFOAM-6, which sort of isn’t OpenFOAM-612, we need a way to properly update our source-pack
installation of OpenFOAM-6.
5.2 Make the OpenFOAM-6 source pack able to being updated
Since the OpenFOAM-6 source pack is a snapshot of the OpenFOAM-6 git repository13, updating the source
pack is pretty easy. The basic steps are:
1. Initialize a new git repository within the source pack, using git init
2. Point the remote-URL of the newly created git repository to the remote repository of OpenFOAM-6, using
git remote
3. Download the updates, using git pull
4. And finally update the local state of your source pack, using git checkout
Alternatively, we could simply remove the current installation of OpenFOAM-6, download the latest source
pack and re-install afresh. Yet, this would be the less elegant brute-force method of updating our OpenFOAM-
6 installation. Connoisseurs, read on.
5.2.1 Initialization
With git init, we tell git to create a new git repository. If we run this command in a directory with files
being already present, this does not change anyone of them.
After running git init, we fill find that a new folder has been created: .git. The file .gitignore has
been part of the source pack.
5.2.2 Pointing to the remote repository
Next, we need to tell git where to find the updates. We do this, by calling git remote add origin git@github:OpenFOAM/Op
5.2.3 Pulling the updates
After, our repository has been made aware, where to get updates, it is time to download them. This is done
with git pull.
5.2.4 Updating the local repository
After, we have downloaded the updates to our repository, we need to update the local, working files of our
repository. Right now, the updates are present locally, yet the working files – the files we can open and read
with our text editor have not been updated yet. The local, working files are updated by applying the changes
we just downloaded by running git checkout -t -f -b master origin/master.
The checkout command now applies all the changes that have been made to the remote master branch to
our local master branch. Now, all the local files have been updated, and we can recompile the source files.
Note, that we need to update the third-party source-code directory in the same way as we updated the
OpenFOAM source-code directory.
5.3 Recompile the source pack
The last step to update any installation from source, is to recompile the sources. This can be conveniently done
by running
./ Allwmake - update
