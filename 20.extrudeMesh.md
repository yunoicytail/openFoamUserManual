### 20 extrudeMesh
extrudeMesh是一个非常特殊的工具，OpenFOAM将其列在了网格生成工具下面，但其实extrudeMesh在网格生成和网格处理过程中都具有作用。我们可以利用其进行网格生成，例如从2D STL表面挤出一个单元层，以便为OpenFOAM中的2D研究准备网格；同时当我们在STL表面上“生长”单元层时，我们也可以利用其对网格进行处理，其本质上是一种网格扩展工具。

#### 20.1 使用方法
extrudeMesh由文件extrudeMeshDict控制，该文件包含使用该工具的所有必要设置，大致可分为以下几类：“在哪里增长”，“增长什么”和“如何增长”。

##### 20.1.1  constructFrom
ConstructFrom设置用于确定拉伸的来源。单元拉伸的基础可以是现有网格的边界或STL表面。在网格边界的情况下，拉伸源也可以是另一个算例的边界，例如：从算例Y拉伸出X以创建算例Z的网格。对于STL表面，需要使用surface关键字提供相应的STL文件。如果我们使用网格边界层，则可以选择保留源网格还是丢弃源网格。图35显示了从当前案例中拉伸边界时这两个选项之间的区别。

##### 20.1.2  Layer control
The “what to grow” part consists of the number of cells in thickness direction of the new cell layer, the thickness and an optional expansion ratio.
**expansionRatio**
Note, that the expansion ratio describes the expansion of thickness from one layer to the other. This is in contrast to the expansion ratio we use with the grading feature of blockMesh, there the expansion ratio describes the thickness ratio between the smallest and the largest cells at the boundaries of a block.

##### 20.1.3  Extrusion models
The extrusion models control the “how to grow”. There is a number of models available, some of which will be discussed below.
**Plane extrusion**
The plane extrusion model is specifically for the creation of (quasi) 2D meshes. A single layer of cells is extruded in normal direction to the povided surface. By default the front and back patches are created to be of type empty.
In Figure 36 we see the mesh created from an STL, which was created by GMSH. In this case we could also have used GMSH to create a mesh with a single cell in thickness direction.

Figure 36: The mesh for a 2D study generated from an STL surface.

**Sector extrusion**
Figure 37 shows the result of the sector extrusion model. For this model, the user needs to specify a point in space (axisPnt), an axis of rotation (axis) and an angle. In this case the outlet patch of the original mesh (shown in grey) was extruded. The original mesh was created by blockMesh and consists of 5 blocks (easily scripted with e.g. Python). The axisPnt lies in the plane of the outlet patch, however, the point is well outside the patch. The distance between the axisPnt and the centerline of the original pipe mesh determines the radius of the pipe bend. The positive x-axis was selected as axis. The newly generated cells are by default added to a cellSet named addedCells.
This use of extrudeMesh opens a rather cheap way to create good meshes of pipe bends. The blockMeshDict for a straight pipe is easily scripted, and by extruding along the section of a circle, the mesh is continued along a bend. Directly scripting the blockMeshDict for a pipe bend would definitely be a little bit harder.
The sector extrusion model also has a 2D “cousin”, which is called wedge. The class underlying the wedge extrusion model is derived from the sector model. However, the wedge model is the axisymmetric analogue of the plane model. Thus, only one cell layer is created, which is centered about the source surface, i.e. the cell layer is extruded half the angle in both directions from the source surface.

**Linear extrusion**
There are two models for linear extrusion in extrudeMesh. There is linearNormal, which extrudes in normal direction of the underlying surface. This can be used to grow a cell layer on the pipe’s wall, see Figure 39. Furthermore, there is linearDirection, which extrudes cells along a specified direction.
In Figure 38 we see the result of subsequent use of extrudeMesh. Unfortunately, at the time of writing (using OpenFOAM-4.0), extrudeMesh does not offer the -dict option. Thus, we need to repeatedly edit the extrudeMeshDict for subsequent applications of extrudeMesh. First, a bend was created by using the sector model. Afterwards a straight pipe section was created using linearNormal, which is followed by a slanted pipe section, which was created using linearDirection.

**Pitfall: extruding a too narrow 2D slice**
The mesh for an axi-symmetric simulation is a slice of the full 3D domain, which is 1 cell in circumferential direction. Figure 40 shows two examples, which differ only in the angle of the slice. Both seem like valid meshes, when viewed in ParaView.
Yet, with the narrow angle, OpenFOAM complains of the wedge-type patches being non-planar. Listing 148 shows an example of such a warning message. Increasing the angle from 1 to 5 degrees solved this problem. This problem could not be solved by increasing the write precision to large values.
