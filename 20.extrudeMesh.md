### 20 extrudeMesh
extrudeMesh is a rather special tool. OpenFOAM lists extrudeMesh under the mesh generation tools, however, extrudeMesh has a role between mesh generation and mesh manipulation. We can do mesh generation, e.g. extruding one cell layer from a 2D STL surface in order to prepare the mesh for a 2D study in OpenFOAM. However, we can also do mesh manipulation, which is essentially mesh extension, as we “grow” cell layers on surfaces.

#### 20.1 Control
extrudeMesh is controlled by the file extrudeMeshDict. This file contains all necessary settings for using this tool, which can roughly be divided into the categories: “where to grow”, “what to grow”, and “how to grow”.

##### 20.1.1  constructFrom
The constructFrom setting is used to determine the source of the extrusion. This basis for cell extrusion can be either a patch of an existing mesh or an STL surface. In the case of a patch of an mesh, the source may also be a patch from another case, e.g. extrude patch X from case Y to create the mesh of case Z.
For the case of an STL surface, the corresponding STL file needs to be provided using the surface keyword. If we use the patch of a mesh, we can choose between retaining the source mesh or discarding it. Figure 35 shows the difference between these two options, when extruding a patch from the current case.

##### 20.1.2  Layer control
The “what to grow” part consists of the number of cells in thickness direction of the new cell layer, the thickness and an optional expansion ratio.
**expansionRatio**
Note, that the expansion ratio describes the expansion of thickness from one layer to the other. This is in contrast to the expansion ratio we use with the grading feature of blockMesh, there the expansion ratio describes the thickness ratio between the smallest and the largest cells at the boundaries of a block.

##### 20.1.3  Extrusion models
The extrusion models control the “how to grow”. There is a number of models available, some of which will be discussed below.
**Plane extrusion**
The plane extrusion model is specifically for the creation of (quasi) 2D meshes. A single layer of cells is extruded in normal direction to the povided surface. By default the front and back patches are created to be of type empty.
In Figure 36 we see the mesh created from an STL, which was created by GMSH. In this case we could also have used GMSH to create a mesh with a single cell in thickness direction.

**Sector extrusion**
Figure 37 shows the result of the sector extrusion model. For this model, the user needs to specify a point in space (axisPnt), an axis of rotation (axis) and an angle. In this case the outlet patch of the original mesh (shown in grey) was extruded. The original mesh was created by blockMesh and consists of 5 blocks (easily scripted with e.g. Python). The axisPnt lies in the plane of the outlet patch, however, the point is well outside the patch. The distance between the axisPnt and the centerline of the original pipe mesh determines the radius of the pipe bend. The positive x-axis was selected as axis. The newly generated cells are by default added to a cellSet named addedCells.
This use of extrudeMesh opens a rather cheap way to create good meshes of pipe bends. The blockMeshDict for a straight pipe is easily scripted, and by extruding along the section of a circle, the mesh is continued along a bend. Directly scripting the blockMeshDict for a pipe bend would definitely be a little bit harder.
The sector extrusion model also has a 2D “cousin”, which is called wedge. The class underlying the wedge extrusion model is derived from the sector model. However, the wedge model is the axisymmetric analogue of the plane model. Thus, only one cell layer is created, which is centered about the source surface, i.e. the cell layer is extruded half the angle in both directions from the source surface.

**Linear extrusion**
There are two models for linear extrusion in extrudeMesh. There is linearNormal, which extrudes in normal direction of the underlying surface. This can be used to grow a cell layer on the pipe’s wall, see Figure 39. Furthermore, there is linearDirection, which extrudes cells along a specified direction.
In Figure 38 we see the result of subsequent use of extrudeMesh. Unfortunately, at the time of writing (using OpenFOAM-4.0), extrudeMesh does not offer the -dict option. Thus, we need to repeatedly edit the extrudeMeshDict for subsequent applications of extrudeMesh. First, a bend was created by using the sector model. Afterwards a straight pipe section was created using linearNormal, which is followed by a slanted pipe section, which was created using linearDirection.

**Pitfall: extruding a too narrow 2D slice**
The mesh for an axi-symmetric simulation is a slice of the full 3D domain, which is 1 cell in circumferential direction. Figure 40 shows two examples, which differ only in the angle of the slice. Both seem like valid meshes, when viewed in ParaView.
Yet, with the narrow angle, OpenFOAM complains of the wedge-type patches being non-planar. Listing 148 shows an example of such a warning message. Increasing the angle from 1 to 5 degrees solved this problem. This problem could not be solved by increasing the write precision to large values.
