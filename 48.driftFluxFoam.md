### 48 driftFluxFoam
*driftFluxFoam* is a solver of OpenFOAM to simulate e.g. settling of disperse particles in a liquid. driftFluxFoam is the successor of settlingFoam, which has been discontinued with the release of OpenFOAM-2.3.1138.
*settlingFoam* was used by Brennan [12] in his thesis, which contains a lot of information on deriving the drift flux model from the Eulerian two-fluid model equations. The header of driftFluxFoam describes this solver as follows:
	Solver for 2 incompressible fluids using the mixture approach with the drift-flux approximation for relative motion of the phases.
	Used for simulating the settling of the dispersed phase and other similar separation problems.
*driftFluxFoam* complys with the generic solver design of OpenFOAM, thus this solver can use all available turbulence models. It also can use the MRF method and the fvOptions framework.
#### 48.1 Governing equations
The governing equations for the mixture are derived from the two-fluid model [12, 31].
##### 48.1.1 Mixture continuity equation
The mixture continuity equation can be easily derived by adding the continuity equations of the two phases:
(129)
with the constitutive relations
(130)
(131)
we gain
(132)
##### 48.1.2 Mixture momentum equation
**Derivation from literature**
The derivation of the mixture momentum equation is analogous to the derivation of the mixture continuity equation. Therefore, we skip the general derivation and refer the interested reader to the appropriate literature [12, 31]. In this section, we want to focus on the derivation of the specific equations implemented in driftFluxFoam.
We start from the derivation given in the appendix of Brennan [12]:
(133)
we pay special attention to the diffusion stress ********PŒ±kœÅkukmukm********, which represents momentum diffusion due to the relative motion between the phases.
(134)
For convenience we introduce the symbol œÑdm for the diffusion stress
œÑdm = XŒ±kœÅkukmukm (135)
with ukm, the velocity of the phase k relative to the mixture‚Äôs centre of mass; ukm is also referred to as diffusion velocity of the phase k 
ukm = uk ‚àí um (136)
Ishii and Hibiki [31] states a relation between the diffusion velocities of the two phases:
Œ±1œÅ1u1m + Œ±2œÅ2u2m = 0 (137)
Thus, we can eliminate u1m from the diffusion stress œÑdm
œÑdm = Œ±1œÅ1 Œ±2œÅ2 Œ±1œÅ1 2 u22m + Œ±2œÅ2u22m (138)
œÑdm = Œ±2œÅ2u22m Œ±2œÅ2 Œ±1œÅ1
+ 1
(139)
œÑdm = Œ±2œÅ2u22m Œ±2œÅ2 + Œ±1œÅ1 Œ±1œÅ1 
(140)
œÑdm = Œ±2œÅ2u22m  œÅm Œ±1œÅ1 
(141)
œÑdm = œÅm Œ±2 Œ±1 œÅ2 œÅ1 u22m (142)
**Implementation**
From the source code in Listing 310 we see the diffusion stress an the fourth term on the LHS of the momentum equation.
```
 fvVectorMatrix UEqn
 ( 3 fvm :: ddt ( rho , U)
 + fvm :: div ( rhoPhi , U)
 + MRF . DDt ( rho , U)
 + fvc :: div ( UdmModel . tauDm () )
 + turbulence -> divDevRhoReff (U)
 ==
 fvOptions ( rho , U)
 );
```
Listing 310: The momentum equation of driftFluxFoam

Next, we take a look at the implementation of the diffusion stress.
```
1 tmp < volSymmTensorField > Foam :: relativeVelocityModel :: tauDm () const
2 { 3 volScalarField betac ( alphac_ * rhoc_ ) ;
4 volScalarField betad ( alphad_ * rhod_ ) ;
56 // Calculate the relative velocity of the continuous phase w.r.t the mean
7 volVectorField Ucm ( betad * Udm_ / betac );
89 return tmp < volSymmTensorField >
10 (
11 new volSymmTensorField
12 (
13 " tauDm ",
14 betad * sqr ( Udm_ ) + betac * sqr ( Ucm )
15 )
16 );
17 }
```
Listing 311: The diffusion stress of driftFluxFoam computed by the relativeVelocityModel
And now, we translate the source code into some math:
œÑbm = Œ≤du2
dm + Œ≤cu2
cm (143)
with
Œ≤d = Œ±dœÅd (144)
Œ≤c = Œ±cœÅc (145)
ucm = Œ≤d Œ≤c udm (146)
we gain
œÑbm = Œ≤du2
dm + Œ≤c Œ≤d Œ≤c 2 u2
dm (147)
œÑbm = Œ≤du2
dm 
1 +
Œ≤d Œ≤c 
(148)
œÑbm = Œ±dœÅdu2
dm 
1 +
Œ±dœÅd Œ±cœÅc 
(149)
œÑbm = Œ±dœÅdu2
dm Œ±cœÅc + Œ±dœÅd Œ±cœÅc 
(150)
œÑbm = Œ±dœÅdu2
dm
œÅm Œ±cœÅc
(151)
œÑbm = œÅm Œ±d Œ±c œÅdœÅc u2
dm (152)
We notice, that (152) derived from the source code, equals (142), derived from literature  with phase 2 being the disperse phase d.

**Relative velocity**
The diffusion velocity udm and the drift velocity udj are linked by a constitutive relation:
udm = œÅ1 œÅm udj (153)
We find this relation also in the source code in Listings 316 and 317. Ishii and Hibiki [31] state, that in the case of dispersed two-phase flow the drag correlation should be expressed in terms of the drift velocity udj .
The relative velocity models provide a method that returns udm, however, in the source code of the Listings 316 and 317 we find relation (153) translated into C++. There, the expression for udm consists of the density ratio and a relation for the drift velocity, which links the terminal velocity of a single particle and the volume fraction of the disperse phase.
#### 48.2 incompressibleTwoPhaseInteractingMixture
The class incompressibleTwoPhaseInteractingMixture serves as the transport model for driftFluxFoam. This class holds all the information of the two phases and provides the mixture quantities. driftFluxFoam solves the momentum and pressure equations for the mixture. Thus, this solver is in between a single-phase solver and a full two-fluid solver such as twoPhaseEulerFoam.
Via this transport model, the mixture quantities propagate to the turbulence model, since the turbulence model receives a transport model class as template parameter at construction. This is one example for the versatility of the new, templated turbulence modelling framework. The precursor settlingFoam had a hardcoded k ‚àí  turbulence model. Also the viscosity model was kind of hard-coded.
#### 48.3 Mixture viscosity models
Settling equippment is often operated with solids concentrations at which the presence of the solid particles affect fluid properties. Besides using the mixture density, a mixture viscosity also has to be used.

##### 48.3.1 mixtureViscosityModel
The class mixtureViscosityModel is the abstract base class for the actual viscosity models. This class serves a similar purpose as the base class for the single-phase viscosity models viscosityModel located in $FOAM_SRC/transportModels/incompressible/viscosityModels/viscosityModel. These two base classes are rather similar and there are only slight differences in their implementations.
##### 48.3.2 slurry
The slurry mixture viscosity model is a correction for the Newtonian viscosity with reference to Thomas [60].
(154)
The source code computing the mixture viscosity is a direct translation of the math above into C++.
```
1 Foam :: tmp < Foam :: volScalarField >
2 Foam :: mixtureViscosityModels :: slurry :: mu ( const volScalarField & muc ) const
3 { 4 return
5 ( 6 muc *(1.0 + 2.5* alpha_ + 10.05* sqr ( alpha_ ) + 0.00273* exp (16.6* alpha_ ))
7 );
8 }
```
Listing 312: The calculation of the mixture viscosity by the slurry mixture viscosity model

##### 48.3.3 plastic
The plastic viscosity model is based on a generic viscosity model (155) for liquids exhibiting plastic behaviour.
œÑ = aCb Œ± (155)
The plastic model implemented in driftFluxFoam translates to:
¬µ = min [¬µc + k ‚àó (10n Œ± ‚àí 1), ¬µmax] (156)
Listing 313 shows the source code computing the mixture viscosity. The -1 in the second term ensures, that we retain the laminar viscosity of the continuous phase in the case the dispersed volume fraction vanishes, since anything to the power of zero equals one.

```
Foam :: tmp < Foam :: volScalarField >
2 Foam :: mixtureViscosityModels :: plastic :: mu ( const volScalarField & muc ) const
3 { 4 return min
5 ( 6 muc
7 + plasticViscosityCoeff_
8 *(
9 pow
10 (
11 scalar (10) ,
12 plasticViscosityExponent_ * alpha_
13 ) - scalar (1)
14 ) ,
15 muMax_
16 );
17 }
```

##### 48.3.4 BinghamPlastic
BinghamPlastic is a Bingham plastic model.

#### 48.4 Relative velocity models - hindered settling
In this section we use the symbol v for the velocity to follow the notation of Brennan [12] as well as the source code of OpenFOAM.
##### 48.4.1 The base class
The base class holds the data common to the derived models. The base class holds the private field Udm_ for the diffusion velocity udm and declares an abstract method correct(). The method correct() is used by the derived classes to compute the diffusion velocity Udm_.
The method Udm() of the base class simply returns Udm_, and the method tauDm() returns the diffusion stress computed from the diffusion velocity.
**The diffusion velocity**
The class for the relative velocity model holds a vector field for the diffusion velocity. The internal field values are determined from the actual model in use, however, the boundary conditions are taken over from the mixture velocity field.
This, we can read from the source code of the base class. In Listing 314 we see the initializer responsible for the diffusion velocity.
```
1 Udm_
2 ( 3 IOobject
4 ( 5 " Udm ", 6 alphac_ . time () . timeName () ,
7 alphac_ . mesh () ,
8 IOobject :: NO_READ ,
9 IOobject :: AUTO_WRITE
10 ) ,
11 alphac_ . mesh () ,
12 dimensionedVector (" Udm", dimVelocity , vector :: zero ) ,
13 mixture .U () . boundaryField () . types ()
14 )
```
Listing 314: The initializer entry for Udm_ in the constructor of the relativeVelocityModel class.

For the interpretation of Listing 314 we need to dig out the appropriate constructor of the class GeometricField139. In Listing 315 we see that the constructor receives five arguments, of which the last has a default value. If we pass only four arguments, the fifth will be determined from the default value.
```
1 // - Constructor given IOobject , mesh , dimensioned <Type > and patch types . 2 GeometricField
3 ( 4 const IOobject &,
5 const Mesh &,
6 const dimensioned < Type >& ,
7 const wordList & wantedPatchTypes ,
8 const wordList & actualPatchTypes = wordList ()
9 );
```
Listing 315: The signature of the constructor called by the code in Listing 314.

If we compare the arguments of the constructor call of Listing 314 and the signature in Listing 315, we see that the first argument passed is clearly an IOobject. The second argument is a reference to the mesh itself, which is obvious from the call to alphac_.mesh() in Listing 314.
The third argument determines the type of the field as well as the initial value. The template parameter Type determines whether the field is a scalar, a vector or a tensor field. As a dimensionedVector is passed in Listing 314, Type evaluates to vector140.
The fourth argument is a list of patch types, since we passed only one dimensioned value as the third argument, there has been no information passed on the boundary conditions of the field up to now. By passing the list of boundary types of the mixture velocity field (mixture.U()), the boundary conditions of the field Udm_ are specified.
As there is no fifth argument passed in Listing 314, the return value of the call wordList() is used.

##### 48.4.2 simple
The model named simple is similar to the model used by Brennan [12] with attribution to Dahl [17]. This model is very similar to the Vesilind [65] model (158), Brennan [12] explains the change of the base from the Euler number e to the base 10 with a closer fit to experimental data gathered by Dahl [17].
vs = v0 10‚àíkŒ± (157)
The implementation of the simple model is more or less a direct translation from math (157) to C++. In the exponent the maximum of the dispersed volume fraction and zero is taken to avoid numerical trouble from negative values of the volume fraction. Reversing the sign in an exponent is never a good idea in numerical simulation.
```
1 void Foam :: relativeVelocityModels :: simple :: correct ()
2 { 3 Udm_ = ( rhoc_ / rho () )* V0_ * pow ( scalar (10) , -a_ * max ( alphad_ , scalar (0) )) ;
4 }
```
Listing 316: The calculation of the dispersed diffusion velocity Udm_ by the simple relative velocity

##### 48.4.3 general
The model referred to as general is most probably basedon the model of Tak√°cs [59], there is no reference to any literature in the header file. The Tak√°cs [59] model (159) is a so-called double-exponential model based on the model of Vesilind [65], see (158) [28, 12].
vs = v0 e‚àínX (158)
vs = v0 

with
vs settling velocity
v0 maximum settling velocity
n model parameter
rh settling parameter for hindered settling
rp settling parameter for low solids concentration
X suspended solids concentration

```
1 void Foam :: relativeVelocityModels :: general :: correct ()
2 { 3 Udm_ =
4 ( rhoc_ / rho () )
5 * V0_
6 *(
7 exp (- a_ * max ( alphad_ - residualAlpha_ , scalar (0) ))
8 - exp (- a1_ * max ( alphad_ - residualAlpha_ , scalar (0) ))
9 );
10 }
```
Listing 317: The calculation of the dispersed diffusion velocity Udm_ by the general relative velocity model.

#### 48.5 settlingFoam
Here we take a closer look on settlingFoam (of OpenFOAM-2.2.x), which is the predecessor of driftFluxFoam. By comparing the implementations of these two solvers we can observe the transition of the OpenFOAM source code base to a more encapsulated approach.
##### 48.5.1 Mixture viscosity
settlingFoam was/is restricted to the plastic or Bingham viscosity models. Listing 318 shows the code of settlingFoam, which computes the mixture viscosity. This code is located in a source file, which is included into the body of the PIMPLE loop of the solver.
Thus, for this solver, the treatment of mixture viscosity is not encapsulated. The viscosity models are not located in separate files and the code of the solver itself contains all the knowledge of the viscosity models. Extending the solver with one or more mixture viscosity models would entail building an extended if-cascade within the file correctViscosity.H.
```
 1 { 2 /* compute plastic viscosity */
3 mul = muc +
4 plasticViscosity
5 ( 6 /* code removed for brevity */
7 );
89 if ( BinghamPlastic )
10 {
11 volScalarField tauy = yieldStress
12 (
13 /* see yieldStress .H */
14 );
15 mul =
16 /* compute contribution of yield stress */
17 + mul ;
18 }
19
20 mul = min ( mul , muMax ) ;
21 }
```
Listing 318: The calculation of the mixture viscosity in the file correctViscosity.H of settlingFoam of OpenFOAM-2.2.x. Comments added by the author.

##### 48.5.2 Relative velocity models
settlingFoam of OpenFOAM-2.2.x offers the same choice of relative velocity models as driftFluxFoam at the time of writing. However, implementation-wise we note, that model selection is, again, done in an if-statement cascade.
```
1 if ( VdjModel == " general ") 2 { 3 Vdj = V0 *
4 ( 5 exp (-a * max ( alpha - alphaMin , scalar (0) ))
6 - exp (- a1 * max ( alpha - alphaMin , scalar (0) ))
7 );
8 } 9 else if ( VdjModel == " simple ")
10 {
11 Vdj = V0 * pow (10.0 , -a * alpha );
12 }
13 else
14 {
15 FatalErrorIn ( args . executable () )
16 << " Unknown VdjModel : " << VdjModel
17 << abort ( FatalError ) ;
18 }
19
20 Vdj . correctBoundaryConditions () ;
```

##### 48.5.3 Turbulence
Turbulence in settlingFoam was/is implemented in a similar fashion as in twoPhaseEulerFoam of that time. Both solvers feature a hard-coded k ‚àí  turbulence model, which is adapted to the solvers needs.
