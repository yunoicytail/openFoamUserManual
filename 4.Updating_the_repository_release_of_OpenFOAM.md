### 4 Updating the repository release of OpenFOAM#### 4.1 Version managementOpenFOAM is distributed in two different ways. There is the repository release that can be downloaded using the Git repository. The version number of the repository release is marked by the appended x, e.g. OpenFOAM 2.1.x. This release is updated regularly and is in some ways a development release. Changes and updates are released quickly, however, there is a larger possibility of bugs in this release. Because this release is updated frequently an OpenFOAM installation of version 2.1.x on one system may or will be different to another installation of version 2.1.x on an other system. Therefore, each installation has an additional information to mark different builds of OpenFOAM. The version number is accompanied by a hash code to uniquely identify the various builds of the repository release, see Listing 9. Whenever OpenFOAM is updated and compiled anew, this hash code gets changed. Two OpenFOAM installations are on an equal level, if the build is equal.```Build : 2.1. x -9 d344f6ac6af```Listing 9: Complete version identification of repository releasesApart from the repository release there are also pack releases. These are upadated periodically in longer intervals than the repository release. The version number of a pack release contains no x, e.g. OpenFOAM 2.1.1. In contrast to the repository release all installations of the same version number are equal. Due to the longer release cycle the pack release is regarded to be less prone to software bugs.There are several types of those releases. The are precompiled packages for widely used Linux distributions (Ubuntu, SuSE and Fedora) and also a source pack. The source pack can be installed on any system on which the source codes compile (usually all kinds of Linux running computers, e.g. high performance computing clusters, or even computers running other operation systems, e.g. [Mac OSX](http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Howto_install_OpenFOAM_v21_Mac) or even [Windows](http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Tip_Cross_Compiling_OpenFOAM_in_Linux_For_Windows_with_MinGW)).#### 4.2 Check for updatesIf OpenFOAM was installed from the repository release, updating is rather simple. To update OpenFOAM simply use Git to check if there are newer source files available. Change in the Terminal to the root directory of the OpenFOAM installation and execute git pull.If there are newer files in the repository Git will download them and display a summary of the changed files.```user@host :∼$ cd $FOAM_INST_DIRuser@host :∼/ OpenFOAM$ cd OpenFOAM -2.1. xuser@host :∼/ OpenFOAM / OpenFOAM -2.1. x$ git pullremote : Counting objects : 67 , done .remote : Compressing objects : 100% (13/13) , done .remote : Total 44 ( delta 32) , reused 43 ( delta 31)Unpacking objects : 100% (44/44) , done .From git :// github . com / OpenFOAM / OpenFOAM -2.1. x72 f00f7 ..21 ed37f master -> origin / masterUpdating 72 f00f7 ..21 ed37fFast - forward.../ extrude / extrudeToRegionMesh / createShellMesh .C | 10 +-.../ extrude / extrudeToRegionMesh / createShellMesh .H | 7 +-.../ extrudeToRegionMesh / extrudeToRegionMesh .C | 157 ++++++++ - - - - -.../ Templates / KinematicCloud / KinematicCloud .H | 6 +-.../ Templates / KinematicCloud / KinematicCloudI .H | 7 +.../ baseClasses / kinematicCloud / kinematicCloud .

In this case Git only checks the repository and displays its findings without actually making any changes. The option responsible for this is --dry-run. Notice, that git fetch is called instead of git pull. *git pull calls git fetch to download the remote files and then calls git merge to merge the retrieved files with the local files. So checking for updates is actually done by git fetch.* ```user@host :∼$ cd OpenFOAM / OpenFOAM -2.0. x/user@host :∼/ OpenFOAM / OpenFOAM -2.0. x$ git fetch --dry - run -vremote : Counting objects : 189 , done .remote : Compressing objects : 100% (57/57) , done .remote : Total 120 ( delta 89) , reused 93 ( delta 62)Receiving objects : 100% (120/120) , 17.05 KiB , done .Resolving deltas : 100% (89/89) , completed with 56 local objects .From git :// github . com / OpenFOAM / OpenFOAM -2.0. x5 ae2802 ..97 cf67d master -> origin / masteruser@host :∼/ OpenFOAM / OpenFOAM -2.0. x$```Listing 12: Check for updates only – updates available```user@host :∼$ cd OpenFOAM / OpenFOAM -2.1. x/user@host :∼/ OpenFOAM / OpenFOAM -2.1. x$ git fetch --dry - run -vFrom git :// github . com / OpenFOAM / OpenFOAM -2.1. x= [ up to date ] master -> origin / masteruser@host :∼/ OpenFOAM / OpenFOAM -2.1. x$```Listing 13: Check for updates only – up to date#### 4.4 Install updatesAfter updates have been downloaded by git pull the changed source files need to be compiled in order to update the executables. This is done the same way as is it done when installing OpenFOAM. Simply call ./Allwmake to compile. This script recognises changes, so unchanged files will not be compiled again. So, compiling after an update takes less time than compiling when installing OpenFOAM.##### 4.4.1 WorkflowListing 14 shows the necessary commands to update an existing OpenFOAM installation. However this applies only for repository releases (e.g. OpenFOAM-2.1.x). The point releases (every version of OpenFOAM without an x in the version number) are not updated in the same sense as the repository releases. For simplicity an update of a point release (OpenFOAM-2.1.0 → OpenFOAM-2.1.1) can be treated like a complete new installation, see Section 3.6.The first two commands in Listing 14 change to the directory of the OpenFOAM installation. Then the latest source files are downloaded by invoking git pull.The statement in red can be omitted. However if the compilation ends with some errors, this command usually does the trick, see Section 4.5.2. The last statement causes the source files to be compiled. If wclean all was not called before, then only the files that did change are compiled. If wclean all was invoked then everything is compiled. This may or will take much longer.If there is enough time for the update (e.g. overnight), then wclean all should be called before compiling. This will in most cases make sure that compilation of the updated sources succeeds.```cd $FOAM_INST_DIRcd OpenFOAM -2.1. xgit pullwclean all./ Allwmake```Listing 14: Update an existing OpenFOAM installation. The complete workflow##### 4.4.2 Trouble-shootingIf compilation reports some errors it is helpful to call ./Allwmake again. This reduces the output of the successful operations considerably and the actual error messages of the compiler are easier to find.#### 4.5 Problems with updates##### 4.5.1 Missing packagesIf there has been an upgrade of the operating system9 it can happen, that some relevant packages have been removed in the course of the update (e.g. if these packages are only needed to compile OpenFOAM and the OS ’thinks’ that these packages aren’t in use). Consequently, if recompiling OpenFOAM fails after an OS upgrade, missing packages can be the cause.##### 4.5.2 Updated LibrariesWhen libraries have been updated, they have to be recompiled. Otherwise solvers would call functions that are not (yet) implemented. In order to avoid this problem the corresponding library has to be recompiled.```wclean all```Listing 15: Prepare recompilation with wcleanThe brute force variant would be, to recompile OpenFOAM as a whole, instead of recompiling a updated library.##### 4.5.3 Updated sources fail to compileIn some cases, e.g. when there were changes in the organisation of the source files, the sources fail to compile right away. Or, if there is any other reason the sources won’t compile and the cause is not found, then a complete recompilation of OpenFOAM may be the solution of choice. Although compiling OpenFOAM takes its time, this may take less time than tracking down all errors.To recompile OpenFOAM the sources need to be reset. Instead of deleting OpenFOAM and installing it again, there is a simple command that takes care of this.```git clean - dfx```Listing 16: Reset the sources using gitThe command listed in Listing 16 causes git to erase all files git does not track. That means all files that are not part of the git-repository are deleted. In this case, this is the official git-repository of OpenFOAM. git clean removes all files that are not under version control recursively starting from the current directory. The option -d means that also untracked folders are removed.After the command from Listing 16 is executed, the sources have to be compiled as described in Section 3.3.##### 4.5.4 Own code fails to runUpdating your repository release of OpenFOAM leads to interesting effects. When libraries of OpenFOAM are updated, their implementation might change. Even if the updated code is fully compatible with the previous one, the compiled libaries might look different after the update. Thus, even if the update maintains code compatibility, the update might break binary compatibility. Thus, a recompilation of your own code following the update of the underlying OpenFOAM installation is required.Lost binary compatibility after an update of OpenFOAM leads to segmentation faults when loading a library with lost binary compatibility. This happens because our own solvers dynamically load the required libraries of OpenFOAM at start-up and the memory layout of certain objects of the library has changed since the update.See the following resources for further information on this topic:* (https://community.kde.org/Policies/Binary_Compatibility_Issues_With_C%2B%2B)* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code_compatibility)* (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_compatibility)Losing binary compatibility happens not after every update, and it also does not happen to every library. Thus, you may encounter such problems long after the update, and after you successfully used other solvers and libraries of your creation. Thus, the source of the issues described in this Section may not be immediately clear to the user. Thus, if your code suddenly fails to run properly for no good reason, recomile and see what happens.
