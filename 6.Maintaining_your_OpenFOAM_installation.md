###6 Maintaining your OpenFOAM installation

Due to the ease of having multiple versions of OpenFOAM installed side-by-side on your system, there is the issue of long-term maintaining of your OpenFOAM installations. Over the years OpenFOAM installations may accumulate on your system. Furthermore, the operating system as well receives attention from its developers in the form of updates and upgrades.

####6.1 Dealing with OS updates
Over time, the operating system you are running will recieve lots of updates, unless you only work on machines that are not connected to the internet. Usually, updates to the operating system do not affect your OpenFOAM installation. If your OpenFOAM installation ceases to work properly following an OS update, a version conflict is the most likely culprit. In such a case, a total rebuild from source, as outlined in Listing 18 should solve the problem.

**Trouble-shooting tip: reboot your machine and try again, this may actually help**
OS updates can cause weird errors. Your trusted author encountered a situation in which mpirun ceased to work, and the error message, contained a stack trace which featured words such as memory mapping and such. This problem was most likely caused by OS updates which updated the MPI library and/or kernel updates. However, the problems disappeared when the machine was rebooted. 

Having a long uptime, i.e. is has been a very long time since the computer last rebooted, is only recommended for computing server, which do not receive updates frequently, and are best not connected to the general internet. A normal workstation, which is frequently updated, should be rebooted regularly. The author has experienced multiple occasions, when the workstation after several kernel updates (these are ones that require a reboot to take effect) with no reboot started to behave weirdly.

####6.2 Dealing with OS upgrades
Upgrading the operating system nearly always required a total rebuild from source of your OpenFOAM installation. An upgrade to your OS is very likely to update many or even all libraries and packages OpenFOAM depends on. Thus, trying to run OpenFOAM applications after an upgrade to the OS might result in odd errors, e.g. OpenFOAM failing to launch due to its inability to load shared libraries such as libmpi.so.XX, with XX being a version number.

In the case of the updated OS, libmpi.so.YY was present at the system, with YY being a different version number than XX. This slight oddity of the error: OpenFOAM reporting a missing libmpi library, with a libmpi library being present at the system; indicates a version conflict due to the OS upgrade. OpenFOAM tries to load the version of the library when it was installed, yet due to the intervening OS update a newer version of the library replaced the older one.

Hence, after an OS upgrade total rebuild from source is nearly in all cases warranted. Especially when the underlying OS is some sort of long-term release, such as the LTS versions of Ubuntu, which are released every two years. With a long OS release cycle, we are almost guaranteed to run into version problems after the OS upgrade.
Thus, after upgrading the OS, we run a total rebuild from source as shown in Listing 18. First, we enter the installation directory, clear the installation with wclean all and finally run Allwmake. Note, that this needs to be done with all your OpenFOAM installations, that were installed prior to the upgrade.
```
cd $WM_PROJECT_DIR
wclean all
./ Allwmake
```

Running old versions of OpenFOAM is generally not recommended, as they might or will contain bugs which have long been fixed since. However, for checking on old simulations or re-running them to compare them with current runs, it is quite handy to have a functional installation at hand.
